# Structural-Reliability
Evaluation of the reliability index of reinforced concrete structures.
This is a little program to evaluate the reliability index and the failure probability of an one span, simply supported, reinforced concrete beam subjected to a uniform distributed load,using the Monte Carlo Simulation Method.
